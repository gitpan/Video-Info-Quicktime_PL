Video/Info/Quicktime_PL version 0.04
=======================

pure Perl implementation to extract header info from Quicktime (TM) files.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Video::Info
Compress::Zlib
Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker

Digest::MD5 (only for the test scripts)


COMMENTS

This module is intended to extend the functionality of the Video::Info
module by Allen Day.  In contrast with Video::Info::Quicktime, this is
a pure perl implementation -- so the OpenQuicktime library is not
needed.  This gives the information extraction functionality to any OS
that runs perl, as well as avoiding additional module dependencies to
install.

To install Video::Info without the Video::OpenQuicktime module
installed, just comment out the dependency to Video::OpenQuicktime in
the Makefile.PL file for Video::Info and then proceed as usual.

This release is compatable (and was tested) with version 0.991 of
Video::Info.



This code should be considered to be at an alpha stage of development
with no implied warranty or fitness for a particular purpose.
